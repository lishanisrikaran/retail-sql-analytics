**Objective** To evaluate monthly revenue and order trends and quantify month-over-month (MoM) growth, in order to identify growth patterns, seasonality, and performance volatility that may impact strategic decision-making. 

**Approach:** Using advanced SQL techniques, transaction data was aggregated at a monthly level. For each month, total orders and total revenue were calculated, alongside prior-month comparisons to derive MoM growth percentages for both metrics. <br>

Note: Month-over-month calculations assume continuous monthly data, as the dataset does not contain missing months. If gaps were present, MoM comparisons would require a calendar table to ensure accuracy.


**Key Findings** 
- The business experienced rapid growth during 2017, with sustained increases in both orders and revenue, indicating successful customer acquisition and scaling.
- Seasonal demand peaks are evident in Q4, particularly November, followed by sharp post-peak declines in December and early Q1.
- Periods where revenue growth outpaces order growth e.g. March 2018 suggest improvements in average order value, potentially driven by pricing, product mix, or promotional strategies.
- Several extreme MoM changes highlight either one-off events (e.g. promotions or system launches) or potential data completeness issues that warrant further investigation e.g September 2018.
- From mid-2018 onwards, growth begins to stabilise and flatten, indicating a transition from high-growth to a more mature operating phase.

**Business Implications** 
- Forecasting models should explicitly account for seasonality and volatility to avoid overstating expected performance.
- Marketing and inventory strategies can be optimised by aligning investment with historically high-performing months.
- Leadership should monitor stabilising growth trends as a signal to shift focus from acquisition to retention, basket size, and customer lifetime value.
